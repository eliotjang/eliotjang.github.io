Mon, December 30th 2019 rainy and windy  

*This is my first journal.*  
*I shiver a little but anyway I will do my best.*  

I did **frame of this blog site**.  
Actually, it takes almost 3days. Post text with MacOS Terminal is not easy.  
I feel excited although It should more modify. 

I watch youtube about **C#** and **Unity**. Goal is make game project with my brother.  
after dinner, I **install Unity** and lots of additional elements.  

I couldn't serialize novel that failed efficient time distribution.
