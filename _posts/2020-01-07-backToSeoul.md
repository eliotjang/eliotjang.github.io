Rainy all-day

We overslept.  
Today was go back to Seoul, for my brotherâ€™s medical examination.  
We went to Starbucks and study for about 2 hours, we depart to subway.  
I finished a basic C# for Unity.  
Now I can make own game what I want to implement.  

In the subway, I learned more about how to make a game.  
We arrived at our home, my family was waiting for me and my brother.  
We ate not only meat and onions but also potato soup.
