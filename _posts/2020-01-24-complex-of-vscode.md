Visual Studio Code, same as VS Code is so powerful editer.  
Many Developers used to compile and debugging code.  

Also, I used VS Code for solving algorithms.  
However, I had a problem with using VS Code.  
It doesn’t work the algorithm code.  
I didn’t know how to figure out that I configure preferences with many other blogs.  

VS Code is great, but preferences are very hard for beginners.  
I spent a whole of the days and reset everything of VS Code.
