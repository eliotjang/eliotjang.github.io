I have a dream, travel historic sites of Romance of the three kingdoms.  
Today I watched Television that screen “World Theme Travel” in China.  

So I decided to learn Chinese characters and Chinese.  
Also, I have to read Romance of the three kingdoms.  

I will record introduce of historic sites and editing.  
And upload in my blog and Youtube.  

I don’t mean to say this, I stayed up all night with my college classmates.  
Then, I ride a bus to go to Seoul,  and arrived at 8 o’clock.  

We will depart to Daegu tomorrow to meet kith and kin.
