I stay up all night for make my first game.  
This game is example of other bloger.  
But it is hard to me, because of ingorance about Unity and C#.  
Anyway, I upload this game in my github, blog and youtube.  

I met my friends to have a drink.  
It's been 6 months since I didn't meet.  
Although my friend "Bruse Bong" is not here, I video call him.  
He seems not bad. :D
