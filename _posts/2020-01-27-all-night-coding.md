Every student of computer science and engineering commonly stay up all night coding.  
It feels good when I complete solving problem ownself.  

But that acting has terrible problem.  
One’s immunity weakens for a few days.  
One’s jet lag being changed.  

Sometimes you want to solve the problem before going to bed.  
But **keep in mind** that you gonna weaken for a few days.  

I also stay up all night coding sometimes.  
**Take responsibility for your choice**.  

Thank you for visiting my blog.
