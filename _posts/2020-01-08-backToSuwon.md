Cold

I woke at 12 o’clock.  
My brother finished a medical examination, we went to Wangsimni.  
While father stops by his company, we around the electronic shops.  
We saw LG Ultra, Canon m50, Macbook, Surface, etc.  
It was so interesting to watch all of the electronics devices.  

Father drove us to the rented room.  
After organizing the room, I ate McDonald’s, Mega Mac.  
It was huge…  

I studied grammar of C# and object LifeCycle.  
We ate mom’s food, toast at midnight meal and got ready to go to bed.
