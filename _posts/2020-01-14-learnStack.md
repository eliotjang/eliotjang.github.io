We woke up early.  
**The early bird catches the worm.**  

We went to Open-Lab and studied each part.  
Today I interested my brotherâ€™s learning.  
He studied Algorithm, the Stack with C++.  

The site name is HackerRank that he usually upload code.  
I worked C++ preferences in Visual Studio Code, commonly called VS Code.  

After lunch, my brother went to Seoul and I went to Cafe, Starbucks.  
I upload in HackerRank site about Algorithm, Stack.  

It was fun to study Computer-Algorithm after a long time.  


*I made up my mind to study Computer-Algorithm steadily.*
