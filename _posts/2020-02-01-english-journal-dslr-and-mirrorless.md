If you heard of DSLR or Mirrorless?  
Both are cameras.  

A few decades ago, the camera is the only DSLR.  
DSLR full name is a digital single-lens reflex camera, digital SLR.  
Simply put, accept light to mirror and show users.  

Mirrorless, as its name is, it is a camera without a mirror.  

Commonly people who don’t know the cameras, DSLR is expensive and heavy and Mirrorless is cheap and light.  

It is usually true, but there is one thing to be said.  
That means DSLR is not always good than Mirrorless.  
It’s overwhelming in terms of sales, Mirrorless.  
People know DSLR is heavy, so many people turn one’s eyes to a Mirrorless camera.  

Due to demand, companies are increasingly investing in mirrorless cameras.  
Sooner or later, Mirrorless performance will also be ahead of the DSLR camera.  

So I want to say, **Mirrorless cameras have enormous potential.**
