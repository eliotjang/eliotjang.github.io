I spent three days trying to solve this algorithm problem, name as Merge two sorted linked lists.  

It was hard to wrestle for a long time.  
But when I got up, I think about the problem and finally, I solved that.  

Data structure is Linked-List.  
I studied the algorithm a year ago.  
I forgot many things, so it was difficult for me.  

Through this agony, I realized something again.  

**Donâ€™t be afraid to go slowly, be afraid of stop going.**
