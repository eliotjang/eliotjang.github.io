We went to Open-Lab.  
Finally, I finished C# for Unity basic.  
Last lecture was UGUI.  
The next lecture is an example game what used I learned skill.  

We ate Korean food and went to play Starcraft 2.  
I realized how much fun to play a board game.  
Splendor was so exciting.  
And other use-map was such fun.  

We back home at 7 o’clock.
