When I woke up, my brother’s friend came to our home.  
He took a leave of furlough from the army.  

We ate 2 chicken and stir-fried rice cake. And we searched what we play games.  

First, we played Soul-Knight, a casual shooting game.  
Second, we played Friends-Marble, a board game.  
Third, we played Everybody’s Marble, a board game.  
Last, we played The Settlers of Catan, a board game.  

Last game was so fun to play together.  
We played the game for about 4 hours.  

We sorted out the leftovers in order and we got ready for bed.
