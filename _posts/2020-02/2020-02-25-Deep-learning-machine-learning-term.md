**Machine Learning**  

  - Limitations of explicit programming
    - Spam filter: many rules
    - Automatic driving: too many rules  

  - Machine learning: "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" Arthur Samuel (1959)  

**Supervised/Unsupervised learning**  

  - Supervised learning:
    - learning with labeled examples
      - training set
    - An example training set for four visual categories

  - Unsupervised learning: un-labeled data
    - Google news grouping
    - Word clustering

**Supervised learning**  

  - Most common problem type in ML
    - **Image labeling:** learning from tagged images
    - **Email spam filter:** learning from labeled (spam or ham) email
    - **Predicting exam score:** learning from previous exam score and time spent  

**Types of supervised learning**  

  - Predicting final exam score based on time spent
    - regression

  - Pass/non-pass based on time spent
    - binary classification

  - Letter grade (A,B,C,E and F) based on time spent
    - multi-label classification
