When I watching C# of Unity lecture, I inspired to make my game.  
First, I just made my second game with I learned today.  
That is not what I want to make.  

I want to make tour my own University with the main character.  
It was interesting that someone studied in school, they won’t be able to stand it until they have played the game.  

I also think about extension packs.  
Not only tour own university but also play FPS game mode, Hide-and-Seek mode, etc.  

After studied, we went to PC room and played Starcraft 2 and League Of Legend.
