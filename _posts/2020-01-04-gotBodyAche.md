Cold

Today was the worst day ever.  
When I woke up, I have a runny nose, a fever, a body ache.  

I couldnâ€™t do anything. However, I have to eat lunch. So I went to a snack shop and ordered rib soup.  

We came back home and my brother ready to go to Seoul. He departed to meet his high school friends.  

I tried to study, but It was hard for my condition.  
So I slept early.

Before I slept, I searched for many kinds of cameras that I have to managed the master of HashTag Circles.

Also, I compared many kinds of cameras I will buy it.  

There are some candidates, Canon EOS M50, Panasonic Lumix g7/g85, Olympus m10 mark3, etc..  

I smoked and lied in bed and slept.
