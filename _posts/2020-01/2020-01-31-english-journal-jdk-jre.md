If you have studied Java language, you may know JDK and JRE briefly.  

So do I learned Java language sophomore in university and installed JDK and JRE.  
However, these days many things are changed.  

Oracle acquired Java and development kit version has changed a lot.  
The latest JDK version is 13.0.2.  
JRE was removed and alternated to Java SE Timezone.  

I learned for Hadoop, so I will install java 8.
