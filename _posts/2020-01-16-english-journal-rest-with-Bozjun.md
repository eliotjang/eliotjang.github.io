I and Bozun woke up late.  
We ordered 2 Black-bean-sauce noodles and 1 Jjambbong.  
Also ordered sweet and sour pork and dumplings.  

5 minutes later, my brother came back from the cafe.  

We ate late lunch and some smoke.  
We didn’t go outside. Just stayed home and play game.  

Game is best to play with together.  
We played just like yesterday.
