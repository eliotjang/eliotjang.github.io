Cloudy

We visited 4 bars to have a drink.  
Each of bar, we drink 2 bottles of Soju.  
I searched when sun will rise. sunrise will 07:47 clock.  
So we spend time in PC room.  

We depart to go EungBong mountain.  
When we arrived mountian, it was full of people.  
So we climed little down.  

But nothing happen because of weather is too cloudy.  
So we disbanded to go home.  

I get a small income about youtube source.  
I slept at 09:00, and awake at 16:00.  
I take a shower and eat dinner.  
After I meet my brother, I went to my brother's rented room.  

I make a video for upload youtube.
