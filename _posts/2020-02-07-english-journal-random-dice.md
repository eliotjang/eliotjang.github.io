Today, my bro found interesting game, name as "Random Dice".  
It was Probability game, but we have to play games strategically.  

Each dices are summoned to the field.  
And dices has a varied ablility.  

The game has two modes, PvP and PvE.  
Both of modes are so excited.  

We played game whole of a day.  
We thought that we should make game like this.
