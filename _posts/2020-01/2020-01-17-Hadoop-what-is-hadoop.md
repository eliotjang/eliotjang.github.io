**What is the Apache Hadoop?**  
 > - The Apache Hadoop is an open source framework. Hadoop can easily handle a large amount of data on a low cost, simple hardware cluster. Hadoop is also a scalable and Fault-Tolerant framework.  
- The Hadoop is not only a storage system. Data can be processed using this framework.  
- The Hadoop system is basically written in Java.  

**The Hadoop Technology:**  
![](https://eliotjang.github.io/assets/images/hadoop/use-hadoop.png){: .align-center}  
 > - Hadoop is Open Source tool from the Apache Software Foundation. As the open source project, we can even change the source codes of the Hadoop system. Most of the Hadoop codes are written by Yahoo, IBM, Cloudera etc.  
- Hadoop provides parallel processing through different commodity hardware simultaneously.  
- As it works on Commodity hardware so the cost is very low. Commodity hardware is low-end and very cheap hardware. So the Hadoop Solution is also economic.  

**Why we should use Hadoop?**  
 > - The Hadoop solution is very popular. It has captured at least 90% of Big data market.  
- Hadoop has some unique features that make this solution very popular.  
- Hadoop is Scalable. So we can increase the number of commodity hardware easily.  
- It is a fault tolerant solution. When one node goes down other nodes can process the data.  
- Data can be stored as a Structured, Unstructured and semi-structured mode. So it to more flexible.
