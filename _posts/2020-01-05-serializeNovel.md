Cold

I didn’t eat anything when my brother woke me up.  
I ate Kimchi Fried Rice made by father.  

We went to Open Lab in KHU as always.  
Today I set up a worldview of fantasy novels.  
This series of novels is “브루스 기행".  
I set up main character and his family. Also, set the area in which he lives.  

I built a development environment for C#.
