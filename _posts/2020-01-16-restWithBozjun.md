I and Bozun woke up late.  
We ordered 2 Black-bean-sauce noodles and 1 Jjambbong.  
Also ordered sweet and sour pork and dumplings.  

5 minutes later, my brother came back from the cafe.  

We ate late lunch and some smoke.  
We didnâ€™t go outside. Just stayed home and play game.  

Game is best to play with together.  
We played just like yesterday.
