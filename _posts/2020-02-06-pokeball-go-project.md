This game is my second game, made with Unity.  

You can control pokeball with **direct key**.  

I want to make some interesting game.  
Always pokemon praody is control pokemon trainor.  
But I want Pokeball has a **Ego**.  
So I allocated some pokemon capsule and pokeball eat pokemon.  

In fact, I want to add story that pokeball dominate the world.  
However I don't have high quality to make game.  

I will make high quality later.  

Thank you for visiting my blog.
