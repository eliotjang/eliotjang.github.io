**What are the different types of data?**  
  - The big data are categorized into three different types:  
  1. Structured Data
  2. Unstructured Data
  3. Semi-Structured Data

**Structured Data**:  
  
>  | Emp. No. | Name | Age | Department | Salary |
  |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
  | 011 | Arati | 46 | Store | 50000 |
  | 022 | Sharmistha | 32 | Marketing | 56000 |
  | 033 | Agnibha | 25 | Marketing | 56000 |
  | 044 | Atmaja | 26 | Security | 51000 |  

  - Structured data are those type of data which are stored already in an order. There are nearly 20% of the total existing data are structured data. All the data generated frome Sensors, weblogs, these are all Machine Generated Structured Data. The human-generated structured data are those which are taken as information from a human. Like their names, addresses etc.  
  - The example of Structured Data is Database.

**Unstructured Data**:

  - The Unstructured data have no clear format in storage. We can store structured data in the row-column database, but unstructured data cannot be stored like that. At least 80% of data are unstructured. All satelite-generated images, scientific data or images are categorized as machine-generated unstructured data. There are various types of human-generated unstructured data. These are images, videos, social media data etc.  
  - The examples of Unstructured Data are text documents, PDFs, Images, videos etc.

**Semi-Structured Data**:

  - It is very difficult to categorize this type of data. Sometimes they look structured, or sometimes unstructured. So that's why these data are known as semi-structured data. We cannot store these type of data using traditional database format, but it contains some organizational properties.  
  - The examples of Semi-Structured Data are Spread Sheet files, XML or JSON documents, NoSQL database data items etc.
