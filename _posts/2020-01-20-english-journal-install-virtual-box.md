I got up early and arrived at Cafe, Starbucks.  
Open Macbook-Pro and watched youtube, Tutorial Hadoop.  

I learned how to install virtual box and knowledge about Hadoop.  
Since I studied enough, I tried to upload posts on my blog.  

When my brother came to Suwon, we met and ate food, a burrito.  
To leave a review, the burrito food was huge.   

We back home at eight.  It was early to back home, so we spent little bit a time.  
We solved algorithms, Trees together.  
We gained strength from each other.  

I blogged my whole code and modified the Hadoop lecture.  
We played a game, HearthStone an hour and ready to go to bed.
