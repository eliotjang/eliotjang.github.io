I got up and went to university.  
We went to the open-lab as usual.  
But some people were there.  
So we up to 3 floors and got into another open-lab.  

Today I edit my blog for upload algorithm what I completed.  
However, there have some problems.  

I wrote my post on mark-down file.  
So I need to know how to use mark-down grammar.  

I learned the whole of my time.  
And I upload my post and went back home.
