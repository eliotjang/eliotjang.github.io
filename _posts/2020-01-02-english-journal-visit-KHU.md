Windy and Cold

When I woke up at my brother's rented home, I took a shower.  
We went to Starbucks in morning to study.  

At twelve o'clock, We went to snack shop to eat lunch.  
After lunch, we go to beauty salon to cut brother's hair.  
And we went to Kyung Hee University that my brother study software convergence. My brohter are in KHU, department of software convergence.  

We entered in study room and studied each one.  
I worked to finished my youtube video with iMovie.  
While I making a video, I relized that I have to make Intro video.  
So I installed After Effect, a editor.  
But It is hard used to make intro.  
I spent whole of time to make intro. Unfortunately, I didn't finished it.  

We back to his rented room with two chickens and beers. We took a shower and arranged to sleep.
