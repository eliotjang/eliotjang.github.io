Yut-nori is one of the most popular traditional Korean board games.  
When I arrived at mother’s parents, we played Yut-nori.  

Our relatives always play Yut-nori to play whole people.  
Our family always lose and give winners for money.  

However today we won and get a whole of money.  
We talked that we will gonna be good things in this year.  
And mon and my brother ready to bed in here, and dad went to his home.
