I woke up late.  
Today I did not go out and just stayed in the home.  
I wait for my brother to come back to Suwon.  
We ate toast that my mother made.  

We studied at home.  
Because we donâ€™t have much money to eat outside.  

But I had little burn out. So today I rest about searching Pro Gamer.  
Because I want to know why they played a game for the whole life.  
I want to make a great game that people played interesting and fun.  

We ate noodle and rice. And I slept.
