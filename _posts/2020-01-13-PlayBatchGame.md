I woke up and went to play League of Legend.  

It is one of the most famous game in the world.  
Most teenager will know this game.  

New-season has open about 1 week ago.  
If players played 10 games, their ranks batch game will be finished.  

I didnâ€™t play 10 games. Because one game has so much time to cost.  
I played 5 games. I will play the game, if I get rest time.  
I win 3 games and defeat 2 games.
