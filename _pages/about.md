Hi guys, I'm Computer Science&Engineering senior.  
I wants to record my life to make this Blog.  
It seems strange that I put posts mixed.  
I'm trying to rearranged my blog.  
Thanks for visit my weird blog :D

"Scratch Paper" page contains what I want to know.  
"Projects" page contains main project and side project.
"Novels" page contains what I serialize novel.
"Journal" page contains my everything.
"Github" page links to my github address.
