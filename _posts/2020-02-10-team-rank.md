Did you hear of League of Legends?
I played the game with my alumnus.
We played games a total of seven games and won everything.
I take on a role, through the jungle.

I wanted to do a few more rounds of games, but it was too late.
We parted with a promise of the next time.

**Games seem to be an important means of communicating with people far away.**
