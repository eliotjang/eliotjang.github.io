Cold

I made a video at dawn.  
It was very hard but I can't stop.  
It made me in a spirit of the rivalry.  

So I finished making and upload to youtube channel "엘리엇장, Eliot Jang".  
I took a video with my high school alumni. It's very thanksful to them.  

When I woke up, I depart to open lab in university.  
My brother told me I can install public software that university runs.  
So I download Photoshop, Preimere  Pro, Hancom etc.  
But Mac was incompatible of all programs.  
So when I arrived at home, I remove all of that.
