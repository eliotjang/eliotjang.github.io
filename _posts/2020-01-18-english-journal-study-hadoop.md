I got up at three.  
After washing, I went to a cafe that was open 24 hours a day.  

I studied Hadoop and Big Data.  
I searched on Youtube.  

The lecture was total 60 over.  
I learned lecture and then blogging on my blog.  

Scratch page gonna be plentiful.  
I took minutes for faculty.  

I went back home and met my mom and brother.  
We went to and unlimited refill of beef.  

We ate 3 dishes of beef and went back home.  
Mom was departed to Seoul and I and my brother got ready to go to bed.
